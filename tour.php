                            <p>Sri Lanka may be a small island, but every inch of it is packed with stunning landscapes, sandy beaches, clear blue waters, ancient ruins, heritage sites, wildlife reserves and natural rainforests. The compact size of the island means that you could be snorkelling on the west coast one day, tracking leopards in the southeast the next day, and hiking in the cold misty mountains the following day. The country’s easily accessible and varied landscape lets you experience more during your holiday herhere. Furthermore, Sri Lanka has generally great weather all year-round, so you can visit the country at any time of year. However, take note that due to the monsoon rains, the west and south of the country is more suitable from November to April, while the east and north east are more suitable for travel from May to October.</p>
